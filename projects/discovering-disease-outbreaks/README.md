# Discovering Disease Outbreaks

In this project, a curated list of headlines are examined for location information (city, country) and disease reports. The locations are plotted and then grouped (Kmeans, DBSCAN) to examine possible outbreak clusters.

This project is based on one of the case studies in "Data Science Bookcamp" by Manning.
