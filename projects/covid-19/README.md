# COVID-19 - A Study of Imperfect Data

In this developing situation, it is difficult to have accurate, clean data. The factors
that contribute -- lack of testing capability, overwhelmed medical systems, 
events spanning the full 24 hours worth of time zones, 
and a mix of other intentional or unintentional missing information -- can't be controlled.

In addition, this is an evolving health crisis with wide interest and a lot of fear and uncertainty.
Rather than model disease outbreak or other epidemiological factors and inadvertently portray these visualizations
as expert information, this study will look at other factors or questions, such as:

- As the same patterns play out in different countries, how does the speed of reaction change?
- How does the changing information affect other systems, such as businesses, schools, or online communities?


## Evolution of this project:

### Phase 1:

   * 2020-02-02 to 2020-02-17
   * Data gathering: Individual decoding of WHO daily reports, collection of data from China, Taiwan, 
    and other countries. Data collection was time consuming and aligning timestamps was
    problematic. 
   * Data analysis: Focus on keeping up with the online updates from China and communicating the rapidly changing data.
   * Data reporting: Online visualizations were built with Tableau Public.

### Phase 2:

   * 2020-02-18 to 2020-03-11
   * Data gathering: Transitioned to using only the daily reports from the Johns-Hopkins GitHub repository at
   https://systems.jhu.edu/research/public-health/ncov/ csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports  
       * This simpified data handling and improved consistency with other reports.
   * Data analysis: This phase looked at discrepancies between the data from China and that from other
   parts of the world.
   * Data reporting: Online visualizations built with Tableau Public.
    
### Phase 3: 

   * 2020-03-12 to present
   * Data gathering: Daily statistics (confirmed, recovered, deaths) are from the Johns-Hopkins GitHub repository.
   * Data analysis: Tracking the U.S. response in particular as both citizens and government entities decide 
   how to react.
   * Data reporting: Online visualizations built with Tableau Public initially.
