# Collection of Data Science projects from coursework to personal projects



## Coursework
* Data Science Book Camp (Manning) - Early beta testing of the live project idea using 
Project #3 from the book.


## How-To
* GeoNamesCache 1.1.0 Library - exploring the current status of the project and how to use the methods. [Jupyter Notebook](how-to/explore_geonamescache.ipynb)

## Projects
These are my personal projects into data that I find interesting.

* Covid-19 
I began tracking this data manually in early February. The project has changed methods and focus over time and 
is still active. See the project [README](projects/covid-19/README.md)
