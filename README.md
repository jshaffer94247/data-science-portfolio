# Data Science Portfolio

This is a collection of my personal data science projects. Feel free to browse for inspiration for your own projects or to see tips and tricks on some of the libraries I've found useful. Python code is provided in Jupyter notebooks with explanations via text or graphics.
Please contact me via [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jshaffer94247) if you are interested in discussing any of these projects.

## How-To

These notebooks explore interesting supporting libraries and solutions to data science issues.

 - ### GeoNamesCache 1.1.0 Library

 This library provides methods to get names, locations, and other statistics for countries and cities of the world. My notebook explores the current status of the project and how to use the methods. [Jupyter Notebook](how-to/explore_geonamescache.ipynb)


 - ### United Nations Population Data

 Population data provided by the UN requires some modifications for use in data science. My notebook explores one way to create pandas-ready data. [Jupyter Notebook](how-to/explore_UN_population_data.ipynb)

## Projects

 - ### COVID-19 
I began tracking this data manually in late January 2020 when it was a small outbreak disrupting the Chinese New Year celebrations. The world has changed since this project began; it is no longer socially responsible to present my unreviewed findings and this project has been SUSPENDED. [README](projects/covid-19/README.md). 
Follow-up work is continuing via the Kaggle COVID-19 related challenges where data scientists are working to gather information to assist epidemiologists.

 - ### Discovering Disease Outbreaks
This project takes a file of disease related headlines and explores how to map the mentioned locations onto world maps to visualize potential disease outbreak areas; this work stemmed from a project in the upcoming Data Science Bookcamp (Manning, March 2020).[README](projects/discovering-disease-outbreaks/README.md).

 - ### 2018 GDP Forecasting
Using the World Bank GDP data of 2017 and earlier, predict the 2018 GDP for each country of the world.
