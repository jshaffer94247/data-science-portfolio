# Collection of Data Science projects from coursework to personal projects



## Coursework
### Data Science Book Camp (Manning) - early beta testing of one of the exercises in the book


## How-To
### GeoNamesCache 1.1.0 Library - exploring the current status of the project and how to use the methods.

## Projects
These are my personal projects into data that I find interesting.

### Covid-19 
I began tracking this data manually in early February. The project has changed methods and focus over time and is still active. See the project [README](projects/covid-19/README.md)
