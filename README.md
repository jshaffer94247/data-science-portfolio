# Data Science Portfolio

This is a collection of my personal data science projects. Feel free to browse for inspiration for your own projects or to see tips and tricks on some of the libraries I've found useful. Python code is provided in Jupyter notebooks with explanations via text or graphics.
Please contact me via [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jshaffer94247) if you are interested in discussing any of these projects.

## How-To

These notebooks explore interesting supporting libraries and solutions to data science issues.

 - ### GeoNamesCache 1.1.0 Library

 This library provides methods to get names, locations, and other statistics for countries and cities of the world. My notebook explores the current status of the project and how to use the methods. [Jupyter Notebook](how-to/explore_geonamescache.ipynb)


 - ### United Nations Population Data

 Population data provided by the UN requires some modifications for use in data science. My notebook explores one way to create pandas-ready data. [Jupyter Notebook](how-to/explore_UN_population_data.ipynb)

## Projects

 - ### COVID-19 
I began tracking this data manually in late January 2020 when it was a small outbreak disrupting the Chinese New Year celebrations. The project has changed methods and focus over time and  is still active. 
	- The world has changed since this project began; see the project [README](projects/covid-19/README.md).
	- Follow-up work is continuing via the Kaggle COVID-19 related challenges.

 - ### Discovering Disease Outbreaks
 * Based on the soon-to-be-published Data Science Book Camp (Manning), this project takes a file of disease related headlines and explores how to map the mentioned locations to visualize potential disease outbreak areas.

 - ### 2018 GDP Forecasting
 * Using the World Bank GDP data of 2017 and earlier, predict the 2018 GDP for each country of the world.
