##Data Science Coursework

Coursework is great for foundations, and as I add new skills and insights I like to come back to refactor and explore the data in 
other ways. Here's a quick overview of what's in here:


- Manning: Data Science Bookcamp
	Publishing data expected to be ~March 2020. I had the opportunity to work through some of the projects prior to publication. The 
	full project is not included here (Manning reserves those rights), but my code is here and conversations are welcome. 
	
	
- Coding Dojo & Matrix DS:
	One of the projects in the course used data from the World Bank to predict 2018 GDP per country. This project is perfect for re-factoring
	as I've been adding to my time series analysis toolkit.
